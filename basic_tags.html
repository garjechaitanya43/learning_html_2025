        the most endearing deity to the devotees. Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati is the epitome of pride and honor to the city of Pune. Devotees from every part of India and the world come here to pray to Lord Ganesha every year. Today, Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Temple is not only one of the most highly revered places of worship in India but an institution that is actively engaged in social welfare and cultural development through Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust. The temple speaks of a long and glorious history. The deity of Lord Ganesha was incepted by Shri Dagdusheth Halwai and his wife Lakshmibai way back, when they lost their only son to the plague epidemic.
